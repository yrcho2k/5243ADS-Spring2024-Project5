+ **Project summary**: 
- Overview
Our project aims to predict the likelihood of follow-up dates in a speed dating scenario using machine learning techniques. We utilize a dataset containing various attributes such as attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, and more, collected from participants in speed dating events. Our analysis involves exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of attributes and correlations, followed by building predictive models, including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, to determine which features contribute most to the likelihood of a follow-up date. By leveraging these models, we seek to provide insights into the factors that influence successful matches in speed dating and offer guidance for optimizing future speed dating events.
